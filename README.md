BB Crafts is a craft/hobby business that I have had for several years. 
This site was designed as the final project for my Fundamentals of JavaScript class in the Fall of 2016. 
I used HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to design this site. I did all of the graphic work on this site as well.
I used Adobe InDesign, Animate and Illustrator to do most of the graphic work for the site. 
This was the first site that I used JavaScript on. JavaScript is used several different places on the site, 
it is used for the mouse over feature on the navigation bar, it controls the contact form and probably 
my favorite use is for switching between two heart graphics on the products page. 
I really had a lot of fun designing this site.
